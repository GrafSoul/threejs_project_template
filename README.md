# Basic template for a project with Three.js

## Description

During the course of mastering the Three.js library, practice is not uncommon. It is for this purpose that a template repository was created to quickly start the next project.

Inside the template:

- Customized Webpack build
- Configured eslint and prettier
- Pre-installed libraries `three` and `gsap`
- There is a starting initialization of the `three.js` scene

## Beginning of work

1. Use this repository as a template and create your own repository
2. Clone your repository and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm i
     ```
3. To start the development server with hot realod:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
4. To build the sources:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
5. To run `eslint` on project code:
     ```bash
     npm run lint
     ```
6. To run `eslint` on the project code with possible corrections:
